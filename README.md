# Magento Encoded Modules
The purpose of this repository is to maintain a list of Magento 1 / Magento 2 vendors who use encoding to obfuscate code; making life difficult for clients and developers. This list will serve as a **WARNING** to clients and Magento developers to either stay away from these vendors or use them at their own risk as the underlying code used in their modules is not readable.

## Risk of Using Ecnoded Magento Modules: 
* Encoded modules cannot be debugged.
* Slows down active development.
* Cannot be pen-tested for security.
* Prevents LTS support if vendor is no longer available.
* Prevents PHP version upgrading.
* Impact on application performance.
* Some hosting providers may not allow encoded files on the server.
